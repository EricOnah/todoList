EJS - Embedded JS templating 

Error encounter and how it was solved - Loading css in EJS
First I linked the css using the correct file path "../public/css/styles.css"
Then I set up express.static() in the server.
Everything looked ok but my css was not Loading. Used the browser inspect for debugging and it error shown in the console
was "Refused to apply style from 'http://localhost:3000/public/css/styles.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled."
and in the network tab it was status code for my css file was "404" meaning not found.

The solution was that because I was already serving the public folder in express.static I did not need to include
public in the file path in my ejs file. The file path should be "/css/styles.css"

NOTE: For the work route the key is use the data from req.body.list which returns whatever we have in value
attribute of the submit button. Using ejs var to get what we have saved as the var that is dynamic depending on 
which route we are on, we can now use conditional if statement to decide which array our new item get stored in
and which route is returned.
