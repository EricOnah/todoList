EJS - Embedded JS templating 

Error encounter and how it was solved - Loading css in EJS
First I linked the css using the correct file path "../public/css/styles.css"
Then I set up express.static() in the server.
Everything looked ok but my css was not Loading. Used the browser inspect for debugging and it error shown in the console
was "Refused to apply style from 'http://localhost:3000/public/css/styles.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled."
and in the network tab it was status code for my css file was "404" meaning not found.

The solution was that because I was already serving the public folder in express.static I did not need to include
public in the file path in my ejs file. The file path should be "/css/styles.css"
